I made this game as a part of my final highschool year project with a couple of my friends. Though I worked on multiple other games with my group, this one was a solo endeavor. This had gone through multiple different iterations to get everything working just right, even if the concept is very simple. Obviously there will be flaws but it is something i am proud to have made with the knowledge i had back then.
